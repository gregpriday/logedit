# Logedit

Logedit is a Python utility that auto-generates changelogs from git commits using OpenAI's APIs.

## Installation

You can install Logedit from PyPI:

```bash
pip install logedit
```

You'll also need to set your OpenAI API key:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```

## Usage

You can specify the version, the path to the changelog file, the AI model, and whether to append the new entry to the original changelog file using the `--version`, `--changelog`, `--gpt3`, and `--append` arguments, respectively:

```bash
logedit --version [current_version] --changelog [changelog_file] --gpt3 --append
```

The `--version` parameter can be used to specify both the old and new version in the format `old_version:new_version`. If only the new version is provided, Logedit will get the most recent version tag in your git repository as the old version. If no new version is provided or "HEAD" is given, GPT-4 will try to infer the new version based on the changes found in the commits.

The `--changelog` parameter is the path to your `CHANGELOG.md` file.

The `--gpt3` flag can be added to use the GPT-3.5 Turbo model for generating the changelog. If it's not provided, GPT-4 will be used by default.

If `--append` is provided, the new changelog entry will be automatically appended to the specified changelog file.

If you're generating a changelog for version `0.2` with version `0.1` as the old version and your `CHANGELOG.md` is in the same directory, you would use the command:

```bash
logedit --version 0.1:0.2 --changelog CHANGELOG.md --append
```

If you only provide the new version `0.2`, Logedit will consider the most recent tagged release in your repository as the old version:

```bash
logedit --version 0.2 --changelog CHANGELOG.md --append
```

Shorter aliases `-v` for version, `-c` for changelog, `-3` for GPT-3, and `-a` for append are also available:

```bash
logedit -v 0.2 -c CHANGELOG.md -3 -a
```

## How it Works

Logedit retrieves all commits between the old and new versions specified. It then uses OpenAI's GPT-4 (or GPT-3.5 Turbo, if specified) to summarize each commit. 

Next, it feeds the tail of your current `CHANGELOG.md` file, the new version (or its best guess if not specified or "HEAD" is provided), and the commit summaries to the selected AI model and generates a changelog entry in the same format as your existing `CHANGELOG.md`.

If the `--append` option is used, the new entry is automatically added to your changelog file.
